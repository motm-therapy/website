# Rates

$135 per hour for Individual and Couple sessions. Cash, check and all major credit cards accepted for payment.

## Insurance

Services may be covered in full or in part by your health insurance or employee benefit plan. Please check your coverage carefully by asking the following questions:

- Do I have mental health insurance benefits?
- What is my deductible and has it been met?
- How many sessions per year does my health insurance cover?
- What is the coverage amount per therapy session?
- Is approval required from my primary care physician?

Insurance carriers we accept are Aetna only at this time.


## Session Reminders

Clients will be sent email and/or text notifications prior to sessions as a courtesy reminder.  



### Cancellation

If you do not show up for your scheduled therapy appointment, and you have not notified us at least 24 hours in advance, you will be required to pay a $75 no show fee.  If there are 3 consecutive no show/no calls the theraputic alliance will be terminated.

#### Reschedule

Appointments moved to a different time slot during the same week as the original appointment will not accure a fee.
