# Fees

The following rates are for cash-only clients that do not have, (or wish to use), an insurance policy to cover fees for services.
Per ethical guidelines, fees for cash-only clients are based on "usual and customary rates" for the client's local area.

Insurance companies negotiate their own reimbursement rates with providers as well as co-pay, deductible, and premimum rates with policy holders (clients).
As a result, insurance coverage/reimbursement rates and co-pays vary greatly based on insurance policy and may be more, (or less), than the cash-only rate.

## By Policy

Clients will be notified, in writing, each time a therapy session is scheduled with a provider.
This notification usually comes via text message, but may also come via email.
For same-day appointments, this notfiication may be provided within 24 hours of the scheduled appointment time.

If a client has not received a written notification of a therapy session, please contact the practice immediately to confirm the appointment time.
Until the client receives written notification of the confirmed appointment, it **is not** considered officially scheduled by the practice.

### No-show

A no-show (also known as a "non-appearance") is considered a failure to cancel a scheduled therapy session with a provider,
via email, phone call, voicemail, or text message,
prior the start of a scheduled therapy session of which the client was notified of,
in writing, prior to the start time of the session.

If a client is so late to a scheduled therapy session that it would be ineffective to hold a session within the remaining scheduled timeslot,
and holding a reduced-length session would prevent the provider from billing insurance, (if applicable), for the session at the original length,
the session **will** be considered a no-show, and the client will be given the option to reschedule the session at a later time and/or date.

If the client is late enough to prevent billing of their insurance,
but not so late that using the remaining appointment time would be considered ineffective for treatment,
the provider may offer the client the option to pay the provider's cash rate for that session only, instead of billing insurance.
If the client **accepts** this option, the client will be billed the cash-only rate for the originally scheduled service and appointment length.
If the client **does not accept** this option, the client will be assessed the no-show fee and given the option to reschedule the session.

If a provider is so late to a scheduled therapy session that it would be ineffective to hold a session within the remaining scheduled timeslot,
and holding a reduced-length session would prevent the provider from billing insurance, (if applicable), for the session at the original length,
the session **will not** be considered a no-show, and the client will be given the option to reschedule the session at a later time and/or date.
This includes instances where both the client and provider show up on time for a session, but technological difficulties cause significant delays.

### Reschedule

A reschedule of a previously scheduled therapy session conducted less than 24 hours before the scheduled start time of the session is considered chargable,
and a fee will be assessed to the client in accordance with this fee schedule. For the purposes of this fee assessment, the reschedule time is calculated based on when
the client first contacted the practice regarding the reschedule via email, phone call, voicemail, or text message; not when the provider finalized the reschedule.

For example, if a client is scheduled for a session with a provider at 10:00AM on Monday, and the practive receives an email from the client 9:59AM on the previous day (Sunday),
even if someone from the practice does not reach out to the client until 8:00AM on Monday to confirm, the client **will not** be assessed a reschedule fee.

### Cancellation

A cancellation of a previously scheduled therapy session conducted less than 24 hours before the scheduled start time of the session is considered chargable,
and a fee will be assessed to the client in accordance with this fee schedule. For the purposes of this fee assessment, the cancellation time is calculated based on when
the client first contacted the practice regarding the cancellation via email, phone call, voicemail, or text message; not when the provider finalized the cancellation.

For example, if a client is scheduled for a session with a provider at 10:00AM on Monday, and the practice receives an email from the client at 9:59AM on the previous day (Sunday),
even if someone from the practice does not reach out to the client until 8:00AM on Monday to confirm, the client **will not** be assessed a cancellation fee.
