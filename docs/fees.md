# Fees

The following rates are for cash-only clients that do not have, (or wish to use), an insurance policy to cover fees for services.
Per ethical guidelines, fees for cash-only clients are based on "usual and customary rates" for the client's local area.

Insurance companies negotiate their own reimbursement rates with providers as well as co-pay, deductible, and premimum rates with policy holders (clients).
As a result, insurance coverage/reimbursement rates and co-pays vary greatly based on insurance policy and may be more, (or less), than the cash-only rate.

## Insurance

Services may be covered in full or in part by your health insurance or employee benefit plan. Please check your coverage carefully by asking the following questions:

- Do I have mental health insurance benefits?
- What is my deductible and has it been met?
- How many sessions per year does my health insurance cover?
- What is the coverage amount per therapy session?
- Is approval required from my primary care physician?

Insurance carriers we accept are Aethna only at this time.


## By Policy

Clients will be notified, in writing, each time a therapy session is scheduled with a provider.
This notification usually comes via text message, but may also come via email.
For same-day appointments, this notfiication may be provided within 24 hours of the scheduled appointment time.

If a client has not received a written notification of a therapy session, please contact the practice immediately to confirm the appointment time.
Until the client receives written notification of the confirmed appointment, it **is not** considered officially scheduled by the practice.



### Cancellation

If you do not show up for your scheduled therapy appointment, and you have not notified us at least 24 hours in advance, you will be required to pay a $75 no show fee.  If there are 3 consecutive no show/no calls the theraputic alliance will be terminated.

#### Reschedule

Appointments moved to a different time slot during the same week as the original appointment will not accure a fee.
