Jasmine has worked in the field of psychology for nearly 20 years.

Jasmine started her career in Anchorage, AK as a behavioral technician in adolescent residential treatment facilities like [AK Child & Family](https://www.akchild.org/) (formerly Alaska Children's Services) and also worked at Alaska's premier psychiatric hospital: the [Alaska Psychiatric Institute](https://dfcs.alaska.gov/api/Pages/default.aspx).

After moving to Texas in 2011, Jasmine continued working in treatment programs focused on adolescents and/or on the neuro-divergent in facilities like [New Life Children's Center](https://upbring.org/new-life-childrens-center/) and for companies like [Butterfly Effects](https://butterflyeffects.com/). As part of her post-graduate studies, she completed an internship in integrative behavioral healthcare at the [UT Health - Robert B. Green Campus](https://www.uthscsa.edu/patient-care/physicians/location/Robert-B-Green-Campus-Downtown), assisting physicians with patients requiring behavioral intervention through [Solution-Focused Brief Therapy (SFBT)](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapy-types/solution-focused-brief-therapy) as a complementary service to their medical care. After completing her degree (MS) and becoming a National Certified Counselor (NCC), Jasmine began working in private practice gaining valuable experience as a Licensed Professional Counselor - Associate (LPC-A) under the supervision of more experienced professionals.

After completing her association period, (similar to a medical residence, but for therapists), Jasmine was certified as a [Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC)](https://nami.org/About-Mental-Illness/Treatments/Types-of-Mental-Health-Professionals) by the State of Texas. Jasmine then began focusing on specialty certifications in disorders like [Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD)](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/conditions/obsessive-compulsive-disorder). Jasmine opened her own therapy practice, (Matters of the Mind Therapy, LLC), in 2023.

As your counselor, Jasmine will use her rich behavioral-focused and integrative healthcare backgrounds to inform her therapeutic approach. She will work with you to create a strengths-based, goal-oriented, treatment program that is specialized to meet your individual needs.
