Meet Jasmine – Licensed Professional Counselor, Founder of Matters of the Mind Therapy

## Experience

Jasmine is a seasoned mental health professional with nearly two decades of experience helping people feel more understood, empowered, and whole. Her approach to therapy is rooted in compassion, curiosity, and a deep respect for the unique story each person brings into the room.

Jasmine’s journey began in Anchorage, Alaska, where she worked closely with adolescents in residential treatment centers and at the Alaska Psychiatric Institute. These early experiences shaped her understanding of how mental health challenges can affect young people and their families — and how meaningful, supportive relationships can foster healing.

After moving to Texas in 2011, Jasmine continued supporting adolescents and neurodivergent individuals in a variety of clinical settings. Whether working in residential programs or behavioral health agencies, she became known for her steady presence, genuine care, and ability to connect with people often underserved or misunderstood by traditional systems.

In 2018, Jasmine earned her Master’s degree in Clinical Mental Health Counseling from the University of Texas at San Antonio. During graduate school, she was selected for a competitive internship at UT Health’s Robert B. Green Campus, where she worked alongside medical providers to offer short-term therapy to patients with a wide range of concerns. That experience deepened her belief in integrative, collaborative care — something she still values in her practice today.

Jasmine is a Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC) in Texas and holds a specialty certification in Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). She’s also a member of the International OCD Foundation and brings both skill and sensitivity to working with clients navigating intrusive thoughts, compulsions, and anxiety.

In 2023, Jasmine launched Matters of the Mind Therapy — a space where people can feel safe, seen, and supported in exploring their inner world. She works with adolescents, adults, and families, using evidence-based approaches tailored to each client’s goals and needs.

Jasmine is currently deepening her work with Internal Family Systems (IFS) Therapy, a model that’s become central to her approach. She has completed both Level 1 and Level 2 training through the IFS Institute, has served as a Program Assistant for Level 1 trainings, and has had the opportunity to learn directly from IFS founder Dr. Richard Schwartz in advanced workshops. Jasmine is also on track for official IFS certification — a reflection of her commitment to offering clients a grounded, compassionate path toward inner healing and self-leadership.
