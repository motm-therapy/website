## Experience

Jasmine brings nearly 20 years of experience in the field of psychology, marked by a deep commitment to supporting mental health across diverse settings and populations.

Her career began in Anchorage, Alaska, where she worked as a behavioral technician in adolescent residential treatment facilities, including [AK Child & Family](https://www.akchild.org/) formerly known as Alaska Children’s Services, and at Alaska’s premier psychiatric hospital, the [Alaska Psychiatric Institute](https://dfcs.alaska.gov/api/Pages/default.aspx). Here, Jasmine developed a strong foundation in behavioral interventions and gained critical insights into the needs of young people facing complex mental health challenges.

After relocating to Texas in 2011, Jasmine continued her work with adolescents and neurodivergent individuals in settings like [New Life Children's Center](https://upbring.org/new-life-childrens-center/) and with leading behavioral health companies such as [Butterfly Effects](https://butterflyeffects.com/). Her time at these organizations equipped her with specialized skills in therapeutic support for vulnerable populations and underscored her passion for working with marginalized adolescents.

Building on her field experience, Jasmine earned a Master’s degree in Clinical Mental Health Counseling from the [University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA)](https://www.utsa.edu/) in 2018. During her studies, Jasmine was selected for a highly competitive internship in integrative behavioral healthcare at the [UT Health - Robert B. Green Campus](https://www.uthscsa.edu/patient-care/physicians/location/Robert-B-Green-Campus-Downtown), where she collaborated with physicians to provide behavioral health interventions through [Solution-Focused Brief Therapy (SFBT)](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapy-types/solution-focused-brief-therapy), supporting patients as part of a holistic medical care team.

After graduation, Jasmine became a National Certified Counselor (NCC) and began her journey in private practice as a Licensed Professional Counselor - Associate (LPC-A). Under the mentorship of seasoned professionals, Jasmine gained invaluable experience and earned a certification in [Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD)](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/conditions/obsessive-compulsive-disorder), which, along with her membership in the International OCD Foundation, reflects her dedication to providing specialized care for clients with OCD.

Having received her [Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC)](https://nami.org/About-Mental-Illness/Treatments/Types-of-Mental-Health-Professionals) certification from the State of Texas, Jasmine founded Matters of the Mind Therapy in 2023. Her practice is dedicated to providing compassionate, evidence-based therapy to individuals seeking mental health support.
