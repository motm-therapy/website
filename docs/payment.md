# Payment

Payments are collected via one of the following methods:

- Insurance Only (Insurance pays all fees directly to provider, client pays nothing to provider)
- Insurance Reimbursement (Client pays all fees to provider upfront, insurance reimburses client some/all later)
- Insurance With Co-pays (Insurance pays most fees directly to provider, client pays remainder to provider)
- Cash-only (Client does not have insurance and pays provider their cash rate)
